# Basic Steps To Package The Example Mod
*To package your mod you must go into the project settings and enable pakchunks. You must also go to engine properties and enable allow chunkid assignment. Then select the files for your mod, right click, asset actions, and give it a id. The ID for the Russell mod is 1. Then package the project for windows 64 bit and once done find the pak chunk and name it the same as your mod name, ex : ExampleMod.pak *Once your mod is packaged, place it into the Mods folder. *Steps and docs will be added soon.
